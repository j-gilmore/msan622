<H4>Data Hierarchy</H4>

<p>This data is a combination of Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics and the Occupational Outlook Handbook, also from the BLS.  The levels of data can be thought of in two ways: <br>
    <br>
    <b>Industry</b> shows the 22 different industries by the points in the inner circle, then branches for each of the professions.  You can add states to see the distribution of positions in the economy.<br>
    <br>
    <b>States</b> shows each of the 50 states in the inner circle, then industries.  You can add professions too, but be patient as it may take a moment to create.</p>
