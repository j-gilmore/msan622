<H3>About Word Stems</H3>
<p>In order to make a more in-depth analysis of any corpus of text, word stems are used.  Word stems are the root of a word and reduce redundency within a corpus.  For example, the word 'resolve' may have many endings such as resolve<b>s</b>, resolv<b>ed</b> or resolv<b>ing</b>.  By using the word stem, we can evaluate one root word instead of three words that have the same meaning.</p>
