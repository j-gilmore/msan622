<H3>About Word Clouds</H3>
<p><b>Commonality Clouds</b> use and exhibit the most used word stems of the entire corpus.</p>
<p><b>Comparison Clouds</b> evaluate how words within each corpus deviate from the mean frequency of the entire collection.</p>
<p><b>Traditional Word Clouds</b> are made by taking the word frequency of a corpus of text, then presenting the results by displaying the words in increasing size as the frequency increases.  If a color scheme is applied, color is also used to reinforce the change in frequency.</p>
