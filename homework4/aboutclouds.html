<H3>About Word Clouds</H3>
<p><b>Commonality Clouds</b> use and exhibit the most used word stems of the entire corpus.</p>
<p><b>Comparison Clouds</b> evaluate how words within each corpus deviate from the mean frequency of the entire collection.</p>
<p><b>Traditional Word Clouds</b> are made by taking the word frequency of a corpus of text, then presenting the results by displaying the words in increasing size as the frequency increases.  Color can also be used to reinforce the change in frequency, however for this visualization a choice was made to maintain consistency throughout the application.</p>
