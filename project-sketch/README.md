## Discussion ##

Data sources include:  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Occupational Employment Statistics (OES), Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH).

1. The concept is that a user will be able to select an industry to see at a high level any trends or anomalies that may not be visible when immersed in numbers.  Then the user can drill down to find out some very specific information.  The goal of the app is to improve upon what is available through the BLS and OOH by bringing the data to life somewhat by making it personal to the user in a practical way.

The visual techniques used will be either heat maps, small multiples, or similar depending on the type of input from the user.  Until further analysis of the data, it is not immediately clear what will be visually appealing or useful.  This section as of yet is somewhat ambiguously designed.

2. After selecting an industry, a graph of small multiples or multiline plot will show professions within the industry and percentile wages/salary.

3.  The user can select a profession, and a geographic location from a subset of available areas using the OES.  Additional graphical representations will be made that show more statistics related to user selections.

4.  Salary percentiles, density, growth rates, saturation, education levels are able to be analyzed, even at the industry level.  Broad or detailed visualizations will be possible.

8.  Pages/tabs will have dynamic interface.  Actual layout may have a dashboard-type feel as interaction is recognizable even though controls will be centralized.  This feature will depend on the visualizations' output needs, or whether interface will be on three pages.  The first for industry parameters and analysis, the second for profession, a third to possibly add a geographic component.
