<H4>Area Charts</H4>

<p>These plots are often misinterpreted. The top-most line in the chart represents the total value of the relationship between variables. The colors represent the shares of the total. In this case we evaluate the three variables, the fatalities of <b>Drivers</b>, <b>Front</b> passengers, and <b>Rear</b> passengers. Remember, the top most line represents the total number of traffic deaths.</p>

<p><b>Fixed Coordinates-</b> is usually easier to interpret provided the visualization is clear as to what is being presented.</p>

<p><b>Polar Coordinates-</b> a little more interesting to possibly reveal some interesting patterns.</p>
