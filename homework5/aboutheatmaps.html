<H4>Heatmaps</H4>

<p>These plots show intensity or frequency of a given event relative to two other events. This plot in particular shows the frequency of driver deaths in a given month and year. The scale frequency is located in the legend.</p>

<p><b>Traditional Heatmap-</b> is usually a square or box-like representation with two axes, in this example month and year.</p>

<p><b>Polar Coordinates-</b> instead of a square representation, the y axis is shown in concentric circles.  A polar representation can sometimes reveal patterns difficult to find in a traditional heatmap. Notice how the frequency of this data is easier to discern with the polar coordinates heatmap.</p>
