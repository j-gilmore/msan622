<H4>Multi-Line Plots</H4>

<p>These plots typically show how more than one variable react over time to the stimulus of another variable, in this case time.  The representations can be made in a number of ways, but it is necessary to keep proper scales of axes to mitigate results being misinterpreted.</p>

<p><b>Small Multiples-</b> is a collection of plots at various intervals showing the reaction in more detail.</p>

<p><b>Polar Coordinates-</b> can be interesting if a single time period is used.  Try to scale the Year Range to a single year and you can track the progress of variables over time radially.</p>
